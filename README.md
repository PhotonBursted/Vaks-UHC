# Vaks-UHC
<h3>A UHC manager for Spigot servers!</h3>

<p>Installation is simple:
<ul><li>Get the jar out of the bin folder</li>
<li>Place it in the plugins folder of your Spigot server</li>
<li>Let the server start up. This will create the necessary folder and files</li>
<li>Put the .csv, also found in bin, inside of the VaksUHC folder, and fill in the teams you'd like to have</li>
</ul></p>
<p>And that's that! Running the server will start the plugin too, load the .csv and convert it into feasible teams :D</p>
