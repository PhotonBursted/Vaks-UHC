# Vaks-UHC
A UHC manager for Spigot servers!

Installation is simple:
1. Get the jar out of the bin folder
2. Place it in the plugins folder of your Spigot server
3. Let the server start up. This will create the necessary folder and files
4. Put the .csv, also found in bin, inside of the VaksUHC folder, and fill in the teams you'd like to have

And that's that! Running the server will start the plugin too, load the .csv and convert it into feasible teams :D
