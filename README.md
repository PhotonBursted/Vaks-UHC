<hr><h5><b>AS OF CURRENTLY, DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PLUGIN IS ON A HOLD.</b></h5>
<p>As the event this was being developed for only needs one plugin, we (I and Flutterflies) have decided to join forces. Seeing the structure of their plugin was a lot better already, I will be focusing all the time I am spending on getting it ready on that plugin, instead of this one.</p>

<p>The plugin can be found right <a href="https://github.com/flutterflies/FwapaDerp>here</a>.</p>
